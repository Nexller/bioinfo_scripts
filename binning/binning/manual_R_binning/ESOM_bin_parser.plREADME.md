The scripts in this directory were used in binning of genomes from various (relatively simple) metagenomes. 

the 'binning_with_R file contains a few lines of R code that I used to do the actual binning, based on data obtained from metagenome assembly with CLC.
The various map files were also generated with CLC, but could also be generated with other aligners.

There are by now automated tools which do this type of binning for you, but in my experience doing the binning manually was not extremely timeconsuming.
Also, manual binning gives you a very clear idea about the quality of your data
